## Background (Streams)

A stream is a sequence of data that is used to transfer data between two sources, such as a file on disk or a network connection. Streams are an abstract representation of data that can be read or written, and they allow you to process data incrementally, rather than having to load it all into memory at once.

In .NET, the System.IO.Stream class is the base class for all streams, and provides a common set of methods for reading and writing data. For example, the Read method is used to read data from a stream into a buffer, and the Write method is used to write data from a buffer to a stream.

Some common examples of streams in .NET include FileStream for reading and writing files, MemoryStream for reading and writing data in memory, and NetworkStream for reading and writing data over a network connection.

Using streams is important for working with large data sets, as it can reduce the memory footprint of your application and improve performance. By processing the data incrementally, you can read or write a portion of the data at a time, rather than having to load it all into memory at once. Additionally, streams can also provide additional functionality, such as compression or encryption, allowing you to further optimize your data transfer.
